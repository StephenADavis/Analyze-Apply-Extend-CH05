            <div class="box sticky">

                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p>Some browsers require a -webkit- prefix to use the sticky element. You must also specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box relative">

                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>I used the values top: 90px and left: 30px, which offets the box from its original position.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box fixed">

                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>I used the top: 90px and right: 10px elements, which locked the box into that part of the screen.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box absolute">

                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>I used the bottom: 0 and right: 0 elements, which moved the box over to the right side of the screen.</p>
